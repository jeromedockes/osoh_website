  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>The goal of Open Science Office Hours (OSOH) is to integrate students and researchers into the open science
    community so they feel empowered to do
    open science
  </p>
  <p>We plan to do this by </p>
  <ul class="main-list">
    <li><span class="icon-ok"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharing resources on different topics relating to open science
    </li>
    <li><span class="icon-ok"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Offering individual support during office hours</li>
    <li><span class="icon-ok"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilitating community discussions on each topic.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>We will start by engaging the neuroscience community at McGill University, and perhaps increase the scope in the
    future.

      One of our goals is to help researchers navigate the open-science resources that are available to them. To this end, we
      have created a page for searching and filtering through resources, according to your needs.
